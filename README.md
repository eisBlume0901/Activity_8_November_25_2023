<p> Create a login form using username and password. If the username or password is wrong prompt the user with "Username/Password is incorrect". 
If the credentials are correct, close the login form and open a new form with a display message"Hello user welcome!". In the login form, 
there should be a repeat password label, if the user clicks on the label another form will open with the textbox old password, new password, 
and confirm new password. Use ArrayList to store values </p>
